Task :
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named jim requires access for a limited duration.
To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:
Create a user named jim on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-02-17, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

SOLUTION: 
Use the following command on the target system (assuming Linux with standard useradd tools:

bash
sudo useradd -e 2024-02-17 jim
sudo: Grants administrator privileges to run the command.

useradd: Standard utility to add a user on Linux systems.

-e 2024-02-17: Sets the account expiration date to 17th February 2024.

jim: Username in lowercase, as per your protocol.

Additional Notes
Ensure App Server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter is accessible (via SSH or local terminal).

Verify the user creation with:

bash
id jim
If account password is required, set it with:

bash
sudo passwd jim


IF WANT TO DELETE THE USER :
sudo userdel jim
