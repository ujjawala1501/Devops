Task: 
xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:
a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 3.
b. Apache should serve on port 3004.
c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/official and /home/thor/cluster on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that official should work on the link http://localhost:3004/official/ and cluster should work on link http://localhost:3004/cluster/ on the mentioned app server.
d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:3004/official/ and curl http://localhost:3004/cluster/

Here are clear and organized **notes** based on your session log:

---

## ‚úÖ **Objective**

Install and configure Apache on `stapp03` so that:

* Apache runs on **port 3004**
* Two sites are served:

  * `/official/` ‚Üí official site
  * `/cluster/` ‚Üí cluster site

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Steps Performed**

### 1. **SSH into Target App Server**

```bash
ssh banner@stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
```

* Accepted SSH key (first-time login)
* Logged in successfully

---

### 2. **Install Apache (httpd)**

```bash
sudo yum install httpd -y
```

* Provided `sudo` password
* Installed httpd and dependencies (13 packages)

---

### 3. **Prepare Content for Websites**

```bash
cd /tmp
mkdir official cluster
mv index.html official/
```

* Created `/tmp/official` and `/tmp/cluster`
* Moved sample `index.html` into both

---

### 4. **Move Content to Apache Root**

```bash
cd /var/www/html
sudo mkdir official cluster
sudo mv /tmp/official /var/www/html/official
sudo mv /tmp/cluster /var/www/html/cluster
```

* Moved folders to the Apache document root

#### Fixed nested folder issue:

```bash
sudo mv /var/www/html/official/official/index.html /var/www/html/official/
sudo rmdir /var/www/html/official/official

sudo mv /var/www/html/cluster/cluster/index.html /var/www/html/cluster/
sudo rmdir /var/www/html/cluster/cluster
```

---

### 5. **Fix Permissions**

```bash
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/
```

* Ensures Apache can read content

---

### 6. **Configure Apache to Run on Port 3004**

#### Edited Apache config file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

* Changed `Listen 80` ‚Üí `Listen 3004`

---

### 7. **Start and Enable Apache**

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

* Apache started successfully
* Confirmed it's listening on port **3004**
* Minor warning: `ServerName` not set (can be ignored or fixed)

---

### 8. **Verify Setup**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3004/official/
```

**Output:**

```html
<h1>KodeKloud</h1>
<p>This is a sample page for our official website</p>
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:3004/cluster/
```

**Output:**

```html
<h1>KodeKloud</h1>
<p>This is a sample page for our cluster website</p>
```
