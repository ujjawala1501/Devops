Following security audits, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.
Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

solution:
ssh tony@<IP address / hostname >  (repeat the same commands for other 2 app servers as well)
To disable direct SSH root login in Linux, the following steps are required: Edit the SSH configuration file.
Open the SSH daemon configuration file, typically located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config, using a text editor with root privileges. For example:
Code

    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Modify the PermitRootLogin directive.
Locate the line containing PermitRootLogin. If it is commented out (preceded by a #), uncomment it by removing the #. Change the value from yes to no.
Code

    #PermitRootLogin yes   (If commented, uncomment it and change)
    PermitRootLogin no
save and close the file and restart the ssh service. 
Apply the changes by restarting the SSH daemon. The command to restart the service may vary slightly depending on the Linux distribution:
Code

    sudo systemctl restart sshd
